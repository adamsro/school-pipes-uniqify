\section{Design Decisions}


    To try to write code which was possibly, slightly, more modular I wrote all the primary functionality into a class. Aside from looking cleaner, I am now able to throw Exceptions and handle the formatting all in the same place. The process really rather procedural by nature though, so the run method really only wraps a series of functions which must execute in order.


    I used a struct to hold the child’s id and all pipes then stored a copy of this struct in a vector for every pipe created. This made it much easier for me to keep things organized.  I also created a typedef to group the read and write file descriptors for a process, which I felt made things a bit more clear. I ended up, however, using malloc for the file descriptor array because I wasn’t able to get this working with a vector... probably because I couldn't figure out the syntax.


    As I pulled data from the sort processes pipes I stored the resulting words in a vector. I then iterated through the vector with std::sort, which with the GNU compiler is apparently introsort, about n log n complexity. I then used std::vector<T>.erase with std::unique to remove all duplicates, probably a bit more then ‘n’ time. All and all the process of calling sort multiple times, then loading into an array and calling sort again seems very inefficient, I wasn’t, however, able to come up with a faster way.

\section{Difficulties}


    Keeping track of which pipes go where and when to close what was definitely confusing. If I were to do this again I would try fifos. On a related matter I still haven't figured out why some of my processes are not terminating.  My loop eventuality calls break; and unleashes some zombies.


    When timing the results I found that I can call up to 60 sort processes on smaller files, and the timings are about the same as 1 sort process. I cannot call any more then one sort process on larger files. Although only speculation, I believe this have something  to do with calling sort on the vector.
